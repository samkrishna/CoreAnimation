This is the repo for an updated version of the exercises from Bill Dudney's CoreAnimation book and tutorials.

Our intention is to update the codebase for Snow Leopard and iOS 4.x (both iPhone/iPod Touch and iPad form factors).

We also want to add automated user testing as per the iOS 4.x automated UX testing framework (UIAutomation). There reference page is here:

Articles detailing how to use UIAutomation can be found here:

Good luck!
